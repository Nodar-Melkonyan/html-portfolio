<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a professional tour guide in Georgia since 2022. I lead people througout Gerogia and make their travel smoother and more comfortable</p>

<p>I love walking a lot. Tbilisi is not an exception. Every time I enjoy my walk here I discover something new. It is an honour to share my experience and knowledge with the guests of our capital.</p>

<p>Tbilisi contains a lot secrets. It might be a challenge for a new-comer to hadle them alone. And here I am!</p>
